 1).Difference between document and window:


                        DOCUMENT                                                                                                                      WINDOW

It represents any HTML document or web page                                                                       It represents a browser window or frame that displays 
 that is loaded in the browser.                                                                                                 the contents of the webpage.
  
It is loaded inside the window.                                                                                             It is the very first object that is loaded in the browser.

It is the object of window property.                                                                                     It is the object of the browser.

All the tags, elements with attributes in HTML are part of the document.                                  Global objects, functions, and variables of JavaScript are members of the window object.

We can access the document from a window using the window. document.                             We can access the window from the window only. i.e. window.window.

The document is part of BOM (browser object model) and dom (Document object model).           The window is part of BOM, not DOM.

Properties of document objects such as title, body, cookies, etc can also be accessed             Properties of the window object cannot be accessed by the document object.
by a window like this window. document.title.

syntax:document.propertyname;                                                                                         syntax:window.propertyname;        

example: document.title :will return the title of the document.                                               example: window.innerHeight : will return the height of the content area of the browser.
